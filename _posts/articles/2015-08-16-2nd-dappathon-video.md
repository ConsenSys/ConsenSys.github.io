On Friday August 14th at 5pm, ConsenSys began its 48 hour “dapp-a-thon” where 12 teams set out to build decentralized applications from scratch for the Ethereum network.

* 1:20 - Participant interviews, “What are you building?”
* 7:30 - Winners announced
* 8:54 - Demos of 3 winning dApps
* 16:38 - Participant interviews, “Why ethereum?”

This video provides a recap of the 3 day event with interviews from the participants as well as demos of the 3 winning dApps! We’d like to congratulate the following teams on winning each respective category: 

**Most popular:** [Studbook Horse Registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3h8kze/consensys_dappathon_studbook_horseregistry/)

**Judges prize:** [Ethercrawler](https://github.com/ConsenSys/ether-crawler)

**Participants choice:** [Tweether](http://technical.ly/brooklyn/2015/09/25/twitter-clone-tweether-shows-potential-blockchain-platform-ethereum/)

All winning teams got 100 ether!

We would like to thank all participants and the following judges:

* Joseph Lubin ([Ethereum](http://ethereum.org)/[ConsenSys](https://consensys.net))
* Lawrence Orsini ([L03](http://lo3energy.com/)/ Trans Active Grid)
* Matt Trudeau ([IEX](http://www.iextrading.com/))
* David Solmonoff ([NY Internet Society](http://isoc-ny.org/))
* Alex Klokus ([Futurism.co](http://futurism.co))

Participants used development tools provided by ConsenSys like the EtherCamp IDE, the BlockApps testnet and deployment system, and Lightwallet. The developers of these tools gave tutorials on how to utilize and integrate these tools into dApps and were accessible if the participants ran into trouble along the way. As a result, most teams were able to create a working prototype of their decentralized vision in just 2 days!
