A DApp is a decentralized App. DApps on Ethereum can be entirely decentralized, meaning peer-to-peer.

**Objective**

Build the best working decentralized application you can in a single day!

**Rules of the dApp-A-Thon**

1. Working Code -- This is not a business plan competition. Your DApp needs to work.

2. Code Only During the dApp-athon -- Come in empty, leave with a dApp. Thinking before the event is of course permitted.

3. Teams -- Two-person teams recommended (but not required). BlockApps interns cannot be on the same team. 

4. If possible, use:

* [Ether.Camp IDE](http://frontier.ether.camp)
* [Light Wallet](https://github.com/ConsenSys/eth-lightwallet)
* [BlockApps](http://blockapps.net)
